# Bike Store Sales Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI

## Overview

This project looks at how a bike store is doing in terms of sales. Using Power BI, I created a dashboard that helps understand what‚Äôs selling well, how customers are behaving, and how different stores are performing over time. The goal was to turn raw data into something useful that can help answer important business questions in a clear and visual way.

**The report includes:**

-Easy-to-use filters to view data by city, product category, store, or time period
-Revenue breakdowns by year, with comparisons to sales targets
-Insights into which types of customers bring in the most sales
-A clear view of which brands and products are performing best
-Visuals like bar charts, KPIs, line graphs, and breakdown trees to help make the data easy to understand

## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (M)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Time Period Covered

The data spans from January 1, 2016, to February 28, 2018.

## Questions This Dashboard Helps Answer

-Which brands and product types are making the most money?
-How do sales change from one city or store to another?
-What kinds of customers are spending the most?
-Are we meeting our sales goals?
-Where can we cut costs or make improvements to earn more profit?
